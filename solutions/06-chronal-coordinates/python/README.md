Unfortunately, my the code for my day 6 solution can't be posted in its current state. Shortly after submitting my answers, I got a knock on the door and was informed that my code was being confiscated and quarantined for exceeding regulatory toxic waste levels.

If I ever go back and ~~completely rewrite~~ improve it, I will post it here.
