## Amy's Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to Advent of Code 2018 in various languages.

If you're reading this and don't know me, then hello! I'm surprised you're here.

I'm using Advent of Code as an opportunity to practice and improve my core programming skills, in addition to learning new languages. 

I don't always use the most efficient techniques, but this is oftentimes deliberate, as I am competing in a leaderboard with friends, and I want my solutions to be unique to a reasonable degree.

I typically initially write all of my solutions in Python, as it's familiar to me and very quick to develop with. Later, I port these solutions to other languages that I'm trying to learn.

Currently, I am writing solutions in
* Python
* Rust
* Crystal
