This is the directory containing project templates for various languages.
Each template is a directory, and in that directory are all of the files and folders for the template that will be copied when making a new project.
Templates for C, Python, and Rust are included. Feel free to use them as exmaples and/or modify them!
The only reserved template name is "blank". A custom template named "blank" will simply be ignored.
